# OpencBot

## Overview

This is a gem to allow bots to be written to fetch and format data that can be easily imported into 
OpenCorporates, the largest openly licensed database of companies in the world. It also aims to be a curated 
set of tools to allow data to be retrieved, formatted and imported on a regular basis.

By including OpencBot you have access to a number of methods for setting up and writing to/reading
from a local SQLite database in which the data can be stored. It is expected to expose two class or module
methods: #update\_data and #export\_data. If the exported data is in the correct format it will be able to
be seamlessly able to be imported into OpenCorporates.

##How to install/create a bot

```bash
mkdir your_bot_name
cd your_bot_name
curl -s https://raw.github.com/openc/openc_bot/master/create_bot.sh | bash
```

##Required methods

A bot module should look like this:

```ruby
Module MyBot
  extend OpencBot
  extend self

  def update_data
    # fetch or scrape data and store (possibly in local SQLite database)
  end

  def export_data(options={})
    # return data (possibly from the SQLite database)
  end
end
```

If you follow the conventions and use these methods (and you must do in order for this to validate)
there are several tasks available to you to run and test the data

    bundle exec openc_bot rake bot:create # creates the bot in the first place
    bundle exec openc_bot rake bot:run    # runs the #update_data method
    bundle exec openc_bot rake bot:export # runs the #export_data method and outputs data to stdout as JSON
    bundle exec openc_bot rake bot:test   # validates that the exported data conforms to the basic data structure expected

## Directory structure

####NB the `data`, `db` and `tmp` directories should not be committed to git

    root
      |_config.yml  # A YAML file with configuration for the bot
      |_data/       # Put persistent data in here
      |_db/         # This is where the sqlite database will be stored
      |_lib/        # For the code itself
      |_spec/       # For the specs
      |_tmp/        # Temporary store

Data in data/ and db/ will be persisted through deployments, but tmp/ will not be persisted.

## How to export the data

### Description of output format

#### The following info is specific to Finance Licenses
#### This is still under discussion and is subject to change. Please ask if unsure.

We expect licence data as a hash with the following keys:

    :sample_date
        required (if end_date is not provided)
    :start_date
        optional
    :start_date_type
        required if :start_date is present
        one of "at", "before", or "after"
    :end_date
        optional (if sample_date is provided)
    :end_date_type
        required if :end_date is present
        one of "at", "before", or "after"
    :company
        required
        a hash with the following keys:
            :name
                required
                a string of the name of the company
            :jurisdiction
                required
                a string of the jurisdiction
                    eg "us_ca"
    :source_url
        required
        a string of the URL of the data
    :data
        required
        an array with a single hash, with the following keys:
            :data_type
                required
                must be :licence
            :properties
                required
                a hash with the following keys:
                    :category
                        optional
                        should be "Financial" -- contact OC if this doesn't apply
                    :licence_number
                        optional
                    :jurisdiction_classification
                        required
                        an array of strings that describe the licence or the licenced company, using the vocabulary of the data source
                        examples might be:
                            foreign bank branch
                            co-operative credit
                            motor vehicle finance
                            trust company
                    :oc_classification
                        not required yet
                        an array of strings that describe the licence or the licenced company, taken from a vocabulary list provided by OpenCorporates

#### About the date fields


### What to do when data no longer exists

It is difficult to  accommodate every type of variation in how data can be classified as 'fresh' or 'out of date' and 
so on. This means that we need help from bot authors in identifying when data is no longer valid.

This will usually mean that you will have to timestamp records for each run, making sure to update the timestamp of 
records that are still available but haven't changed. After each run you may find that some records have "dropped off" 
the source and are no longer available/valid. *For these records* the thing to do when something stops being true 
is to post it with an identical `:properties` as above but with an `:end_date` of `today` and `:end_date_type` of `"before"`, 
*INSTEAD* of a `sample date`.

*For all the current records that are otherwise unchanged* you can still submit them with a new `sample_date` so 
that we know they are still current. After 15 months we assume this is no longer the case, so your code should consider resubmitting unchanged records at least once every 15 months.

## General tips on writing a bot

All data sources are different, so the following are just pointers as opposed to rules.

### Break it into stages

Think about breaking the scraping process down into three stages. This is sometimes referred to 
as "Extract, Transform, Load"

"Extract" would mean saving the pages/data to the data folder. "Transform" means loading these files from the 
data folder and parsing them into the right format (probably a hash). The final step, "Load", simply means saving them 
the the database using the `save_data` method.

#### Example: Extract

```ruby
module MyBot
  extend self
  SOURCE_FILE_URL = 'http://www.dfi.utah.gov/Download/INSTADDR.TXT'

  # ... other methods

  def extract
    src = MyBot.scrape(SOURCE_FILE_URL)
    outfile =  File.expand_path("../data/utah_institutions_file.txt", File.dirname(__FILE__))

    File.open(outfile, "w") {|f| f.write src}
  end

  # ... other methods
end
```

Saving to disk first provides some benefits in terms of being able to re-run a scraper on failure. It also makes it 
easier to trace if there have been problems with the data.

#### Example: Transform

```ruby
module MyBot
  extend self

  # ... 

  def transform
    src_path =  File.expand_path("../data/utah_institutions_file.txt", File.dirname(__FILE__))
    src = IO.read(src_path)

    CSV.parse(src, :headers => true).collect do |row|
      new_row = row.merge(:retrieved_at => Time.now)
      new_row[:company_name] = row[:name].gsub(/[[:space:]]+/, ' ') # for example
      new_row # this is now a data hash ready for import
    end
  end

  # ...
end
```

This is a very simple example. You will probably need to break out the process into more methods, but 
consider keeping them "wrapped" in a transform method so that you and other scraper authors can see what 
is going on in future.

#### Example: Load

```ruby
module MyBot
  extend self

  # ... 

  def load
    data = transform # from our previous example
    save_data([:uniq_id_field], data)
  end

end
```

This is fairly straightforward using one of the included helper methods (see ["Helper methods"](#helper-methods)).

*Why sqlite?* It's important to be able to view and query any data you gather in order to check it's 
accuracy and quality. We use sqlite as an interim storage method because it has very few external 
dependencies and works well in this single user environment. See the ["Working with sqlite"](#working-with-sqlite) section for more details 
on how to query/check data with sqlite See the tips on scraping for more details on how to query/check data with sqlite.

### Write some specs

*Specs are required* :smiley_cat:. If nothing else, specs help to explain what you were trying to do with a particular 
method. We encourage all Bot authors to take the time to write specs, as it pays off in the long run.

Given scraping involves retrieving resources you should be careful 
when writing specs that you *don't request files from the web every time they run*, otherwise you might find yourself getting blocked!
You can achieve this by stubbing out the `scrape` method and returning content from the `spec/dummy_responses` folder 
(see `spec_helper.rb` for details).

#### BAD spec

```ruby
describe MyBot do

  it "should parse a HTML file" do
    response = MyModule.scrape("http://my-interesting-data-source.com")
    MyBot.parse(response).should_not be_empty
  end

  # NO - this will hit the network every time you run the test
  # not only is this slow, but you're putting unnecessary load
  # on the data source

end
```

#### GOOD spec

```ruby
describe MyBot do

  before :each do
    MyBot.stub(:scrape).and_return(dummy_reponse('path/to/saved/html/response/in/spec/dummy_responses/sample.html'))
  end

  it "should parse a HTML file" do
    response = MyModule.scrape("http://my-interesting-data-source.com")
    MyBot.parse(response).should_not be_empty
  end

  # YES - this only uses a file on your local disk
  # This makes for a very fast test - the only downside is
  # that you have to keep your sample responses up to date
  # if they change (html layout for example) on the data source.
  # `stub` will change the method that you pass in, making sure that
  # it's original doesn't get called, but also checking that the new 
  # dummy method will.
  # `and_return` is a way of simulating what that method would have responded with
  # `dummy_response` is defined in the sample spec_helper.rb file

end
```

For general RSpec style guidelines, [http://betterspecs.org/](http://betterspecs.org/) is worth a read.

### Expect it to be interrupted

It's not unusual for scrapes to take several days. Power cuts and accidental keypresses do happen. Your script should contain code that allows it to resume where it left off if interrupted; for example, storing the latest value of a counter, or logging some identifier for each record which allows it to be re-got. The `save_var` and `get_var` methods documented below are useful for this; or you can log identifiers to a sqlite table.

### Check with your own eyes

It's always a good idea to look at the data you've collected to see if you're happy with it. There are several good 
sqlite clients available, or alternatively you can use the command line - `sqlite3 path/to/my/database.db`
Check to see for any obvious issues before submitting your bot.

See the [Working with sqlite](#working-with-sqlite) section for examples on how you can analyse and agregate your data 
to check for issues.

### Documentation, documentation, documentation

You often learn a lot about a domain whilst working on a scraper and it's important that this is saved with the bot. 
Follow the instructions in the generated `README` file and you should be off to a good start. It's important for others 
to be able to review and understand what you've written in case they need to work on it in future.

## Other things to consider

### What category is your scraper?

**Simple** - retrieving a static file in a standard format (e.g. CSV)

**Incremental** - scraping a site by incrementing some id parameter eg. a query string param `?id=47`

**Iterative** - working over a range of possible inputs eg. searching for all the letters from `a..z`

Each of these have their separate challenges and some data sources require a combination of all three. With the 
incremental and iterative steps, it's a good idea to keep track of where you are up to in case you need to stop/restart 
the bot (see the `get_var` and `save_var` example in [Helper methods](#helper-methods)).

## Working with sqlite

This bot includes a copy of the sqlite3 *gem*, but you might need to install the sqlite3 program using your 
package manage (`brew`, `apt-get`, `yum` etc.)

In the root folder of your bot, you should be able to run 

```bash
sqlite3 db/mybotname.db
```

where `mybotname` is the name of your bot. This will open up an sql prompt. A few useful commands:

#### .help
#### .tables

These will let you know what to do in most cases. Commands beginning with a dot (`.`) have a special meaning 
in the sqlite prompt.

#### .mode line

Nice format for reviewing records at the shell

```sql
sqlite> SELECT * FROM us_nj_banks ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 2;
```

```
        licensee_name = RICHARDSON IMPORTS INC
              ref_num = 8901006
business_name_address = RICHARDSON IMPORTS INC1230 ROUTE 73MOUNT LAUREL, NJ 08054
         license_type = MOTOR VEHICLE INSTALLMENT SELLER (CORPORATION)
               status = ACTIVELY LICENSED

        licensee_name = ISAAC,RHONDA
              ref_num = 0805480
business_name_address = EMPIRE TODAY LLC1200 TAYLORS LANESUITE 2BCINNAMINSON, NJ 08077
         license_type = HOME REPAIR SALESMAN
               status = ACTIVELY LICENSED
```

#### .output result.html
#### .mode html

Potentially useful way of reviewing larger numbers of records without a dedicated sqlite program. You have to 
add in the opening and closing table tags yourself though.

```sql
sqlite> SELECT * FROM us_nj_banks ORDER BY RANDOM() LIMIT 100;

-- This would output 100x <tr> tags into a file called result.html in the project root
```

#### GUIs and other clients

There are lots of useful GUI clients for Sqlite3. We've used the following with some success:

* [Navicat Lite (Firefox addon)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/sqlite-manager/)
* [Navicat Essentials (Desktop app)](http://www.navicat.com/products/navicat-essentials)

## Helper methods
By extending OpencBot, you'll have access to the following methods which may be helpful in obtaining, 
saving and transforming data. More detailed usage is found in the generated code and README for new 
bots.

### Relating to sqlite

**save_data ( uniq_keys, values_array, table_name='ocdata' )** - The primary method of saving to the sqlite db.

```ruby
data = [
  {:name => "Acme Corporation Ltd.", :type => "Investment Bank"},
  {:name => "Acme Holdings Ltd.", :type => "Bank Holding Company"}
]
MyBot.save_data([:name], data, 'ocdata')
```

This method saves data in an sqlite database named after the name of this class or module.
If no table name is given, `ocdata` will be used. The table will be created if it doesn't already exist.
The first parameter are names of unique keys, and the data element should be an array of hashes, with keys becoming the field names. 
If the table has not been created or field names are given that are not in the table, they will be created
The save_data method currently saves all values as strings.

**insert_or_update ( uniq_keys, values_array, table_name='ocdata' )** - Update/insert data based on existing key sqlite db.

Similar to `save_data` but attempts to update the row based on the unique_key

**save_var ( name, value )** - save a value to the database

**get_var ( name, default=nil )** - retrive a value, with a fallback if it doesn't exist

```ruby
current_id = MyBot.get_var('current_id', 1) # get the last good id, otherwise return 1
long_scraping_process.each do |page|
  save_to_disk(page)
  MyBot.save_var(current_id)
  current_id += 1
end
```

Allows bot authors to store small bits of information between runs. Unfortunately long running bots tend
to get stopped unexpectedly in development (power cuts, connectivity failures etc.) so these methods are 
useful in picking up where you left off.

**select ( sqlquery )** - Convenience method for selecting records for the sqlite db

```ruby
MyBot.select('* from ocdata') # return everything
```

**save_run_report ( reporthash )** - To be called at the end of each run

```ruby
MyBot.update_data
  super_complicated_scrape_task
  save_run_report(:status => 'success')
end
```

Used by Open Corporates to monitor the status of the bot. 
Please include relevant information such as failures and error messages in the report hash.
`Time.now` is added to the output automatically.

### Other
**scrape ( url, params=nil, agent=nil )** - fetches content from a webserver

```ruby
MyBot.scrape("https://google.com") # returns a string of the page source
```

Retrieves a resource from the web and returns a string. Uses the HTTPClient gem internally which 
handles SSL and gzipped content.

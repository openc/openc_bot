# MyModule Bot

## About the data publisher

Describe the source. Specifically:

* Who is behind it?
* What gives it regulatory power (thus justifying it being in
OpenCorporates)?
* How often is it updated?

## About the data

* Give a sample URL showing a typical page in the source, or
instructions on how to find one.
* Provide references, if possible, to where the meanings of the fields
are defined.

### Data exported

* List the fields that this bot currently exports to OpenCorporates,
along with their meaning within this jurisdiction.

### Data not currently exported, but stored

* List the fields that might be of interest to OpenCorporares in the
future. For example, the source might contain address data, but the
scraper might currently only focus on licenses.

## Assumptions

* What assumptions have you made in preparing the data for export?
  E.g. you might be inferring that a field refers to a company (rather
  than a person) based on a regular expression.

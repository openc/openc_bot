  # The update_data module method is called when the bot is run. This is the only required method a bot needs,
  # and the only requirement that it needs to satisy is that it should save a company as a Hash that
  # conforms to the company-schema (https://github.com/openc/openc_bot/blob/master/schemas/company-schema.json)
  # using the #save_entity method. This method validates the hash, and saves in the database, adding the
  # ISO-3166-2 jurisdiction_code inferred from the name of the module (in this case xy)
  #
  # There are various helpers that we've found useful (see https://github.com/openc/openc_bot/tree/master/lib/openc_bot/helpers)
  # but not of them are required. For example, if you are doing an alpha search ('AA','AB',...) there are
  # intelligent defaults for doing such a search, and in fact you don't even need to write the #update_data
  # method. Similarly for incremental searches (where you are iterating through a series of increasing uids).
  # There are also helpers for normalising dates and text.
